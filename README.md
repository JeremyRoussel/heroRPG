# A Simple Text RPG

This is a lightweight command-prompt based Python game exploring object oriented programming. Heros can be selected with different attributes and methods, and various monsters can be found in a cave. Simple combats and items modify character attributes that define the player and monster status.

Additionally, classes and functions have been placed into subfiles that are imported to the main file to allow for easier maintenance and building on individual files instead of maintaining a singular python file containing all of the necessary components.

To try running, use the following command after cloning:
```
$ python3 heroRPG_2.py
```
